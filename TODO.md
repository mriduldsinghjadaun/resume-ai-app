# Project Update: Resume and Cover Letter Generator

## Completed Tasks

### Backend Updates
- [x] Added new API endpoint `/api/generate-cover-letter` for generating cover letters separately
- [x] Kept existing `/api/generate` for resume generation
- [x] Both endpoints use `GROQ_API_KEY` from `.env`
- [x] Updated `server.js` to import and use the new endpoint
- [x] Added routes to serve `resume.html` at `/resume` and `cover-letter.html` at `/cover-letter`

### Frontend Updates
- [x] Created `resume.html` page for resume generation
- [x] Created `cover-letter.html` page for cover letter generation
- [x] Added navigation links on all pages to switch between resume and cover letter
- [x] Updated `index.html` to include navigation to new pages
- [x] Implemented form validation and API calls for both new pages
- [x] Ensured clean styles and nice display of results

### Files Created/Modified
- [x] `api/generate-cover-letter.js` - New API endpoint for cover letters
- [x] `resume.html` - New page for resume generation
- [x] `cover-letter.html` - New page for cover letter generation
- [x] `server.js` - Updated with new routes and imports
- [x] `index.html` - Added navigation links

## Testing
- [ ] Test `/api/generate` endpoint for resume generation
- [ ] Test `/api/generate-cover-letter` endpoint for cover letter generation
- [ ] Test navigation between pages
- [ ] Verify form submissions work correctly
- [ ] Check that results display nicely on both pages

## Notes
- The existing `api/generate.js` already generates both resume and cover letter, but now we have separate endpoints as requested
- Navigation links allow users to switch between resume and cover letter generation
- Styles are inherited from `styles.css` for consistency
- All endpoints use the same `GROQ_API_KEY` from `.env`
